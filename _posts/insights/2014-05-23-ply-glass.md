<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 justify">The summary questions are a particular way to demonstrate how people based on their experience with of all cubes, are capable of imagine or conceptualize a new iteration just by observing and reflecting on all questions. The creative process becomes not only a one way thought, rather a feedback loop between that bounds creators and users. </p>

	<li>How would you compare all the objects together?</li>
	<li>If you had to make a new object, what would you do?</li>
</ul>
