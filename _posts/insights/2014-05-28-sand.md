<h3 class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 vcenter">The rationalization of the weird idea. <em>"Make an opposite of the previous cube".</em></h3>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 justify"> The first rationalization will become the first feedback that will provide an initial thought on how differently people perceive objects through sensation. With the two cubes, a series of basic but specific questions about sensation will be done to random people. The objective is to determine how any person will experience different responses to the same objects.</p>

	<li>What is the size?</li>
	<li>What color does it have?</li>
	<li>What texture does it have?</li>
</ul>
