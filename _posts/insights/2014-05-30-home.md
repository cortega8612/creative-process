	<p class=" col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 justify">Creative Authentication addresses the meaning of “being creative” in the modern world ideology. Where everything is formulated to be a novelty, new products or new solutions are the valuable ones and similar ideas seem not to be worthy, creativity can be a potent tool if used as a strategy to challenge complex problems.</p>

	<p class=" col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 vcenter">This project was conceived as response to an Internet era where everything is being posted online, and raises questions as:</p>

	<ul class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 vcenter ul1">
		<li>How creativity can be achieved?</li>
		<li>Is it a privilege that only a few have?</li>
		<li>Can it be developed as any other skill?</li>
	</ul>
	
<br/>

	<p class=" col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 justify">Through artistic expression, I intend to demonstrate the potential for a creative process fed by critical feedback. Informed by art, design, and system thinking, the aim of the project is to visualize how creative people travel back-and-forth through a process of materialization and de-materialization of ideas; starting from the abstraction of the mind, moving to the physicality of our reality, and returning back to the abstraction of the Internet.</p>
