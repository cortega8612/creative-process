<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> This project reframes the traditional Design practice, from an object-oriented discipline to a design network system that hubs accessible solutions for all people interested in public spaces development; fostering complex solutions to solve complicated problems through knowledge, collaboration and accessible language/s. 

The developing project is currently is in two stages: the educational and “real world” perspective, mainly focused on the building of teams that will be able to create complex solutions. Instead of looking at design as a discipline that will provide the solution to problems, design should be seen as the tool to create the necessary translations between disciplines: a multicultural, trans disciplinary tool that translate through the language of resiliency.</p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"> Shifting from a position or degree based hierarchy; the teams will be established on a humanistic order, based on experience as expertise. The are not titles or degrees to recognize what is desired in public space, the communities interacts with that public space every day has the same right to decide what to do with it. The training received in education is not meant to decide for others, is meant to listen, synthetize, strategize and design in conjunction with the community.

The necessity of feedback at any creative process is vital, since the scope is both strongly focused and seriously reduced in order to create, propose or define an idea. There is no shame in that part of being human, whenever we focused on creating something, we loose some track of what happens around us. There is no such human capable of being focused in everything and anything at the same time.</p>

<p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Therefore, building continuous feedback loops with the community, stakeholders and resilient teams is essential. It needs to be both objective and subjective; the resilient teams needs to understand the subjective opinions, analyze them, get insights, and with that data, propose it back to the community. But is not about delivering numbers and raw data, it is about translating the meaning of those numbers into experiences, because understanding that translation will allow to create stronger bonds within the community and resilient teams. </p>

	As designer and cofounder of Iguana 4 Studio, a sustainable firm based in Mexico City, I believe everyone and everything is interconnected: people, behaviors, products, services, environments, systems, etc.; and design is the tool that harmonizes those connections. The outcome of the design will be remarkable, profound, weak or disastrous depending on how we manage those connections. The more contextual and cultural information we can get about: Behaviors, functionality, performance, limitations, constraints, the more we will be able to expand the potential solutions. When we know and understand the multiple factors that limit a system, we will discover not linear solutions but resolutions that make sense delighting the senses and nourishing our communities.
