<h2 class="col-md-12 vcenter">About <em>Creative Authentication...</em> </h2>

<p class=" col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 justify">The reason of designing around this topic is because creative people often have ideas that may or may not have potential, but before even trying to develop them, a validation of the idea’s originality seems to be mandatory.</p>

<p class=" col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 justify">My interest is in how the results of an Internet search has become the deciding factor in the value of ideas. The value of an idea decreases based on the number of results with similar features or aesthetic appearances. The internet as digital curator of ideas pushes artists, designers, creators, makers, and anyone with an interest in developing ideas, to constantly search for prior information or new ways of producing ideas.</p>


<p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 vcenter">My insights about creativity.<p>

<p>
	<ul class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
		<li>Feedback is critical to the creative process.</li>
		<li>Creativity is a process, is not only the Aha! Moment, it’s about understanding problems and determining criteria/constraints/affordances.</li>
		<li>Creativity is a tool, a medium to facilitate between stages of a project/product.</li>
		<li>Creativity is the connection between past experiences, analysis from present problems and interpretation for the future.</li>

	</ul>
